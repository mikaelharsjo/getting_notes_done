#Next Actions

## What?
iOS app for [Getting things done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) with [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com). We focus only on the tracking of 'actionable items', the things that´s needs to get done.

## Why?
* Keep all your action items in one system (Evernote) that's always accesible.
* Groups action items by your location (context). Instead of seeing all your 100 actions, you see only those that you can act on right now.
* Items are sorted by priority
* Capture actions anywhere exactly when you first think of them. Using the app or any other Evernote interface.
* Quickly check item of your list when they´re done.
 
## How?
* Every action you track is a note.
* We organize the actions using some notebook conventions. Unfinished is stored in 'Action Pending' and when it´s checked we move it into 'Completed'
* We add context (Where?, What?, When?, Who?) using hierarchical tags.
* All notebooks and tags are automatically created when you run the app the first time.
