#Getting Notes Done
==================

## What?
iOS app for [Getting things done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) with [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com).

## Why?
* Keep all your to-dos in one system (Evernote).
* Groups to-dos by your location (context). Instead of seeing all your 100 to-dos, you see only those that you can act on right now. 
* You can sort by priority, where, who, what.
* Capture to-dos anywhere exactly when you first think of them.
* Keep you in control and not overwhelmed even if you have a TON of things to do.
