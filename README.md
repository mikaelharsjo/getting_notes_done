#Getting Notes Done
==================

## What?
iOS app for [Getting things done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) with [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com).

## Why?
*Keep all your actionables in one system (Evernote).
*Groups actionables by your current context (Where you are), so that you’re not staring at all 80 to-dos that you’ve written down. Instead, you can look only at “Downtown” to-dos, or “My daughter” to-dos. 
*You can sort by priority, where, who, what.
*Allow you to approach what to do next from different points of view, “wearing different hats” and organize and view those items accordingly.
*Have a way to capture ideas and to-do items when you think of them, getting ALL of them out of your head.
*Keep you in control and not overwhelmed even if you have a TON of things to do.
